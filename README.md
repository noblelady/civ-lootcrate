# civ-lootcrate
This is a Lootcrate Script for FiveM that uses QBCore

You can add multiple locations where ever you want them to spawn.

And change what loot items spawn.

And how many max items you want the user to get.

A feature I am still working on is to make it so that this crate will spawn at a random time when the server is up and sends out the email to everyone in the server.
